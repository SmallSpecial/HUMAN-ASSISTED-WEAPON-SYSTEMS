Paper Selection: 
    Group 4 has selected to review Effects of automation and task load on task switching during human supervision of multiple semi-autonomous robots in a dynamic 
	environment by P.N. Squire and R. Parasuraman.

Description: 
Squire and Parasuraman formulated an experiment to find the effects of on the tasking load and level of automation (LOA) to the task decision making of individuals.  
The experiment uses the number of individuals supervising semi-autonomous robots’ teams were divided into four to eight.  The dynamic environment the robots were 
going to interact in a game of capturing the flag.  The decision making of each option on the game was between offensive (capturing the opponent’s flag) to defensive 
(protecting the team’s flag).  The main purpose of the study is to use the results to create an interface to reduce the cognitive load of the human team leader.

Executive Summary:
   Squire and Parasuraman article represents the fundamental aspect of group 4 experiment to know the extent to which humans can cognitively be able to monitor 
   unmanned systems and use them in military operations.  Squire and Parasuraman experiments show the effect of task switching on the cognitive load of supervisory 
   entities (the human) of the semi-autonomous robots in a game of capture the flag.  Group 4 will extend the experiment to use military tactics and goals with the 
   use of simulation instead or robots.

#### Explanation of Rating
   The rate of clarity of exposition is four.  The article was well written, organize and to the point.  The experiment was a design created and executing yielding 
   important information about the research questions.  The results seem to be useful for proceeding to the next stage and design a better interface to reduce the 
   cognitive load on the human supervisor.  The quality of the references was adequate for the level of experimentation and relevant to the subject matter.  The 
   experiment can be easily reproduced if an adequate level of funding available.  This type of robot and competition have been easily performed at the high school 
   and college levels.  Most Robot competitions have demonstrated a capturing the flag game.  The overall rating is based on the average of the other ratings.
