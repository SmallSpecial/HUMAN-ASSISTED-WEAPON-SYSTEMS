## Topic / Purpose Statement


## Introduction

"Twenty years from now, unless we can replace a considerable number of people with robots, it’ll be hard to maintain the current level of war capability,” said Akihisa Nagashima, a former parliamentary vice defence minister and conservative independent lawmaker. “Japan’s (security) situation won’t be more peaceful, so I think this is really serious" (Reuters, 2018). 

Armed forces use technology to gain superiority on the battlefield. Recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Unmanned Systems provide new uses for military operations. The Control of Unmanned Systems can be done at different levels of autonomy. The focus of this research is the Human-autonomy teaming approach. In contrast to Manned-unmanned teaming, the unmanned systems are not operated by human operators. With our research we would like to investigate the possibilities to operate unmanned systems autonomously, to increase the effectiveness of military forces on the near future battlefield.

On July 10, 2013, an unmanned X45B drone made an autonomous landing on an aircraft carrier for the first time.

The military use of autonomous drones in varying degrees of intensity seems to be possible in the foreseeable future. Our basic principle is that the human military leader remains at any time the decision-making authority to carry out military operations. With our research, we would like to investigate the possibilities and limits of human-supervised autonomous systems on the future battlefield. The focus is on the reliability of the Human-supervised autonomous system in a virtual military scenario.

This problem is interesting, as the full military potential of Human-autonomy teaming can currently only be estimated, as the technology required is just being developed. Therefore we rely as part of our research project on the virtual simulation environment ARMA3, in which a human operator can give orders to several autonomous systems at the same time. The following video gives an impression of how the AI control in ARMA3 can be managed.

With the knowledge, we gain from the simulation experiments we try the answer our research questions. Furthermore, we refer to approaches in this field by other researchers and delineate our approach.

This project makes the following contributions:
* Presentation of the current status of research on Human-autonomy teaming in the military field of application.
* Exploration of the possibilities and limits of Human-autonomy teaming in various military scenarios through simulation experiments.

## Related Work / literature review

When searching for literature on the topic of Human-assisted Weapon Systems, we mostly found terms such as Manned-unmanned teaming and Human-autonomy teaming. It is striking that the term Human-autonomy teaming is used more frequently in the latest publications. This is related to advances in the field of autonomous systems in recent years and the resulting potential in the military sector. Manned-unmanned teaming is the collaboration between a system of human inmates and a human remote controlled system without human occupants. In Human-autonomy teaming, the unmanned system is autonomously controlled by an agent or AI and is not remotely controlled by a human operator.

Chen (2018) summarizes recent articles that highlight the growing relevance of using Human-autonomy teaming in the military field. Chen (2018) explains that the Defense Science Board (2016) states that "Intelligent autonomous systems have become increasingly important in military missions" (p.255). Chen (2018) claims that "As these systems become more intelligent and sophisticated - and autonomous - human-autonomy teaming has become a key issue to address" (p.255).

Many research articles focus on ethical and legal aspects of the military use of autonomous systems. 
For example, de Boisboissel (2017) states that "all machines, including autonomous lethal robotic systems, must remain under the tactical control of the military leader" (p.738). According to Chen & Barnes (2014) rules and procedures are designed so that the following ensured: "efficient human supervision of multiple robots, appropriate human trust in the automated systems, maintenance of human operator’s situation awareness, individual differences in human–agent (H-A) interaction, and retention of human decision authority" (p.13).

It is imperative not only to understand the ethical implications of using semi-autonomous entities in war. There is also a need to understand how a human in a human-autonomy team interacts in the war. Squire P. N. & Parasuraman R (2010) conducted an experiment in which a human control a determined number of robots in a capturing the flag game. They collected the data on supervisor (human) task switching performance (complex tasks vs. repetitive tasks) and teams of four and eight robots performance (winning percentage). Squire and Parasuraman wanted to understand how the cognitive load and the Level of Automation (LOA) affected each robot team. Squire and Parasuraman use the results to established ideas on how to better design an interface that would reduce the cognitive load and become more efficient in conducting tasks. This experiment is the foundation for the understanding of the human-autonomy teaming interaction.

It is important to emphasize that, in this context, every final decision has to be made by the human, as this topic is also negatively afflicted and can encounter rejection. By coining the term of the technical singularity, Vinge (1993) warned that immediately after the development of Artificial Super Intelligence, the end of humanity would be imminent. Also, Stephen Hawking warned that AI could bring the end to humanity (Hawking 2014). This scenario has also been used in science fiction films, e.g., The Terminator (1984).

## Research Methods

The subject of interest is relatively new to our group. With the desire to explore the topic, the group started to read articles, books, web-pages, etc. After the initial research the group was able focus the research study into the subject of human-automation teaming. As Creswell & Creswell define this process as a qualitative research process.

The group was interested to find out how the interaction between the human superviser and autonomous systems and what some of the difficulties this new paradigm may have. To refine more this concept the group started to define a model where the human has supervisory functions on the semi-automated assets during simulated operations. The group’s intent to demonstrate the new paradigm using simulation. The intent is to use simulation to collect data, analyze and produce a conclusion based on the results.
  
We want to use Mixed Research Methods to answer research questions related to this projects contributions. In the first step, we want to collect, analyze, and interpret qualitative data through a summary of the results of the related work and interviews with experts in the field of human-autonomy teaming. In the second step we want to collect, analyze, and interpret quantitative data through simulation experiments:

We want to use a Mixed Methods Approach to answer the following Research Questions:

1. Qualitative Research Question: What are the benefits of using human-supervised autonomous systems in a military environment?

* SubQuestion 1: What is the current status of research on Human-autonomy teaming in the military?

* SubQuestion 2: How could autonomous systems be integrated into the armed forces, ensuring that legal aspects are adhered to?


We want to answer these qualitative questions by interviews and literature review.

2. Quantitative Research Question: Does the use of autonomous systems have positive effects on military capabilities?

* Hypothesis 1: Unmanned Systems can be operated autonomously with the same Reliability as Human-operated once in a military scenario.

* Hypothesis 2: By using autonomous systems, military missions can be conducted with less human personnel.

* Hypothesis 3: The use of autonomous systems could extend the range of military operations.

We want to answer this quantitative research question by simulation experiments that are viable for human-autonomy teaming experimentation.

Since the full potential of autonomous systems can only be estimated today due to technologies that are not yet fully developed, we want to use a simulation environment in which these technologies are already available. Therefore we use virtual simulation instead of robotics for our experiments.
