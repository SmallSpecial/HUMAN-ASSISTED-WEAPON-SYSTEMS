## General Introduction (draft)

Armed forces use technology to gain superiority on the battlefield.  Recent breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence and unmanned systems provide new uses for military operations.
The Control of Unmanned Systems can be done at different levels of autonomy. The focus of this research is the Human Autonomy Teaming approach. In contrast to Manned-unmanned teaming, the unmanned systems are not operated by a human operator. 
With our research we would like to investigate the possibility to operate unmanned systems autonomously, to increase the effectiveness of military forces on the near future battlefield.

On July 10, 2013, an unmanned X45B drone made an autonomous landing on an aircraft carrier for the first time.

The military use of autonomous drones in varying degrees of intensity seems to be possible in the foreseeable future.
The basic principle for us is that the decision-making authority to carry out military operations must always lie with the human military leader. 
The question that needs to be clarified is the extent to which humans are cognitively able to monitor unmanned systems and to send them to military missions. 
Furthermore, it has to be clarified how the communication between the military leader and the autonomous system must be defined in order to ensure successful execution of military orders.
The purpose of this Research Project is to understand the limits and possibilities of semi-autonomous deployment of unmanned systems in the context of Human Autonomy Teaming. 
The focus is on the cognitive performance of the human military leader, who places orders in different scenarios for the unmanned system.

This problem is interesting, as the full military potential of Human Autonomy Teaming can currently only be estimated, as the technology required for this is just being developed.
As part of our research project, we, therefore, rely on the virtual simulation environment ARMA3, in which a human operator can issue orders to several autonomous systems at the same time. With the knowledge, we gain from the simulation experiments we try the answer our research questions.
Furthermore, we refer to approaches in this field by other researchers and delineate our approach.
